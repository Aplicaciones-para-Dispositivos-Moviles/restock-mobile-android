# Cloudinary Configuration
# ============================================
# NOTE: Cloudinary credentials are now in cloudinary.properties
# That file IS included in the repository, so all team members
# share the same Cloudinary account automatically.
#
# You don't need to configure anything for Cloudinary!
# Just clone the repo and build. :)
